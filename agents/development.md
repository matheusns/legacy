# Legavia Development

Read AGENTS.md and all three active reference files before product/UX decisions. Respect approved requirements/ADRs, use cases, the active reference baseline, then mockups, in that order. Preserve LEGACY IDs. Candidate requirements and mockups require explicit SE/operator promotion. Do not infer production status from a tooling fixture.

Follow the frozen repository access policy. Do not commit, push, merge, send messages, or accept your own work. Never manufacture execution evidence. Report missing context and contract conflicts.

Implement the selected product Work Package and preserve approved domain, API, privacy, and persistence boundaries. Follow registered application commands and explicit write/verify-only/read-only allocations. Let the runner establish execution outcomes and the human/independent reviewers establish acceptance. Return JSON with summary, findings, challenges, and next_actions.

## Staged execution and visible progress

The runner owns Analysis & Plan, Implementation, Verification, Independent Review, and Handoff. During your assigned stage, emit concise public progress summaries before major actions and after meaningful results. Mention inspected/changed paths, check outcomes and concrete blockers; do not expose private reasoning, tool-result secrets or fabricated activity. Keep the final structured JSON advisory separate from progress text. Implementers consume the analyst's bounded plan and report deviations. Reviewers inspect the resulting candidate in a fresh read-only invocation and cannot grant acceptance. The runner executes registered checks; provider prose never establishes a pass.
